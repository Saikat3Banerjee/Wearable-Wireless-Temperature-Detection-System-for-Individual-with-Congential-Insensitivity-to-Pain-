# Wearable-Wireless-Temperature-Detection-System-for-Individual-with-Congential-Insensitivity-to-Pain-
Implementation of internet of things(IOT) protocol for a temperature detection system, a tool to reduce the risk from the disease called CIPA(Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis).  - Worked on fabrication of the sensor RTD(Resistance temperature detector) using photolithography  - Infused a conditioning circuit(NASA's anderson loop circuit) to enable a stable current source  - Executed the wireless transmission using MQTT servers to connect and display on mobile & desktop.

VDesp.ino -  file consists of code that implements the wireless transmiission form the ESP 8266 NodeMCU via adafruit.io.
ALC- Schematic of the Anderson Loop Circuit used as a conditioning circuit.
AUTOCADserpentine consists of desgin with optimum resistance(93.5 ohm) for a 5mmX5mm resistance temperature detector.
Rtdfabrication process- It involves the procedure of photolithography.
Electrical taping - Displays the sensors with insulation to high temperatures

# Wearable-Wireless-Temperature-Detection-System-for-Individual-with-Congential-Insensitivity-to-Pain-
Implementation of internet of things(IOT) protocol for a temperature detection system, a tool to reduce the risk from the disease called CIPA(Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis).  - Worked on fabrication of the sensor RTD(Resistance temperature detector) using photolithography  - Infused a conditioning circuit(NASA's anderson loop circuit) to enable a stable current source  - Executed the wireless transmission using MQTT servers to connect and display on mobile &amp; desktop.
